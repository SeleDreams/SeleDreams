# Welcome to my profile !

I am SeleDreams, a french developer who mainly develops in C# and C++. 

I want to make games that make people feel intensity, for this I am lately experimenting in Haxe on Armory3D.

I also enjoy producing music.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a game, no more details can be revealed yet.
