# Welcome to my profile !

👋 Hi there! I’m a passionate developer with nearly a decade of self-taught experience. I’ve worked on game development, engine programming, reverse engineering, and more.

I can program in various programming languages. But my most used languages tend to be C++, C# and Rust

🎮 You’ll find various projects on my GitHub, from homebrew development kits to game engine prototypes.

🎵 Besides coding, I compose video game music and am learning Japanese.

🚀 Open to learning new technologies and creating exciting games for players worldwide. 

Note: I have Autism, but I adapt well. Thanks for stopping by!
